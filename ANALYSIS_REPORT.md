9. **Pfizer** - 16 trials (0.6%)
10. **National Institute on Aging (NIA)** - 15 trials (0.6%)

### Data Quality and Completeness

![Sponsor Data Completeness Chart](charts/sponsor_data_completeness.png)

Our analysis benefits from excellent data quality:
- **99.9% of trials have primary sponsor information** (2,480 out of 2,482 trials)
- **33.2% of trials have secondary sponsors** (824 trials)
- Only 2 trials (0.1%) lack primary sponsor data

### Sponsor Concentration Insights

- **High fragmentation**: Despite 2,482 trials, there are 1,355 unique primary sponsors
- **Low concentration**: Top 10 sponsors only represent 7.6% of all trials
- **Diverse ecosystem**: Mix of pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, and government agencies

### Geographic Distribution

![Geographic Distribution Chart](charts/geographic_distribution.png)

- **United States leads**: 745 trials (30.0% of all trials)
- **Global participation**: Top 10 countries represent 70.5% of trials
- **Asian presence**: Japan (201 trials) and China (156 trials) are significant contributors

### Funding Patterns

#### By Sponsor Type

![Sponsor Types Analysis Chart](charts/sponsor_types.png)

- **Academic/Medical institutions**: Largest category, reflecting research-driven approach
- **Pharmaceutical/Biotech companies**: Significant presence with major players like Eli Lilly, Pfizer
- **Government/Public funding**: Important role, especially NIH institutes

#### Trial Phases

![Trial Phases Distribution Chart](charts/phase_distribution.png)

- **Early-stage focus**: Many trials in Phase 1 (198) and Phase 2 (202)
- **Unspecified phases**: 58.5% of trials don't specify phase (likely observational)
- **Limited Phase 3**: Only 114 Phase 3 trials, suggesting funding challenges for large studies

#### Historical Trends

![Recruitment Timeline Chart](charts/recruitment_timeline.png)

- **474 trials registered since 2020**, showing continued investment in MS research
- **75.7% are interventional trials**, indicating therapeutic development focus

## Notable Patterns

### Pharmaceutical Industry Leadership
- Eli Lilly emerges as the most active single sponsor
- Wyeth (now Pfizer) shows historical commitment
- Traditional pharma companies maintain consistent presence

### Academic Research Strength
- Major universities and medical centers heavily represented
- International academic collaboration evident
- Strong presence of European institutions

### Government Investment
- NIH institutes provide substantial funding
- Multiple government health agencies globally contribute
- Public funding supports fundamental research

## Implications for MS Research

### Funding Landscape
- **Distributed model**: No single entity dominates funding
- **Risk distribution**: Multiple funders reduce dependency risks
- **Innovation diversity**: Various approaches and perspectives represented

### Challenges
- **Fragmentation**: Many small sponsors may limit large-scale studies
- **Phase 3 gap**: Fewer late-stage trials may slow therapeutic development
- **Geographic concentration**: US dominance may influence research priorities

### Opportunities
- **Collaboration potential**: Many small sponsors could benefit from partnerships
- **Global expansion**: Underrepresented regions could increase participation
- **Phase advancement**: More support needed for late-stage development

## Methodology

### Data Source
- WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)
- Search criteria: "Multiple Sclerosis", all statuses and recruitment phases
- Export date: September 23, 2025
- Total records: 2,482 trials

### Analysis Approach
- Primary focus on "Primary_sponsor" field
- Secondary analysis of "Secondary_Sponsor" and "Source_Support" fields
- Geographic, temporal, and categorical analysis
- Data cleaning and standardization for sponsor names

### Limitations
- Sponsor names may vary in format across registries
- Secondary sponsors not fully captured in primary analysis
- Some trials may be registered in multiple registries
- Historical data may have different registration standards
